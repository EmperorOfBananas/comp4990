# PHR Web Application

PHR, Personal Health Record, is a set of online tools people can use to access, organize, and make appropriate portions of their lifelong health information available to those who need it.  In particular, a person's PHR can contain information on their family history, immunization records, allergies, medications, list of illnesses, dates of surgeries, and doctor's name and phone number.  

This project is a web application that allows users to share and manage their personal health records. Our project will encrypt the PHRs using CP-ABE, Ciphertext-Policy Attribute-Based Encryption, to make sure that the private data on them is safeguarded. A user can log in, edit their PHRs, control who has access to them, and view other PHRs that have been shared with them.
